# Final Project 2


## Project Description

### 1. `2024_ver_Final.ipynb`
Data were obtained from the Seoul Open Data Plaza and combined into CSV files for analysis.



Main tasks:

- Collect data from the Seoul Open Data Plaza

- Clean and preprocess datasets

- Merge multiple datasets

- Generate final CSV files for analysis
-Row for station
-column for feature


### 2. `Final project_2.ipynb`



This notebook performs the cluster analysis using the processed datasets.



Main tasks:

-Preprocessing

- Data scaling

- Cluster analysis

- Cluster visualization

- SHAP analysis for feature importance



---



## Clustering Results



Key findings:

- The dataset can be divided into 10 meaningful clusters.

- Most features show strong relationships with one another.

- The clusters exhibit distinct characteristics based on the selected features.

## SHAP Analysis



SHAP  was used to evaluate feature importance.



### Main Finding



The feature **`age_entropy`** had the greatest impact on the clustering results

## Summary



This project integrates datasets collected from the Seoul Open Data Plaza, creates a unified dataset, and applies clustering techniques to identify meaningful patterns. The results reveal 10 distinct clusters, strong relationships among features, and indicate that `age_entropy` is the most influential feature according to SHAP analysis.
